_Want to host your own Rōblox LAN parties? Looking for a way to deploy your Rōblox experiences, new and old, on your own machine?_

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/483c4263-db43-4ec2-9243-b0b885e625f6

Rōblox Freedom Distribution is one such solution. It's a revival launcher built on existing research for self-hosting Rōblox servers.

Using RFD, users can host their own server instances from compiled Rōblox binaries from 2018-07-25 or 2021-01-25.

Players can join existing servers.

Clients only need to keep track of which hosts and ports to connect to. That's because _clients will automatically connect to a server of the same version_.

**If you worked with Python 3.12+ before, [_initial_ setup](#download) is supposed to take less than a minute. Why _initial_? Freedom Distribution automatically downloads additional data (at most 90 MiB) for you.**

Initial adaptation from the [Rōblox Filtering Disabled](https://jetray.itch.io/roblox-filtering-disabled) project by Jetray, et al.

All the code is free-as-in-freedom software and is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

_This README is optimised for viewing on [GitHub](https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution)._

## Copyright Acknowledgement

My use of Rōblox's binaries are prone to copyright-infringement issues. Be wary of any potential copyright takedowns.

In the event of a DMCA takedown, don't rely on forks of this repo on GitHub. Consider using other means. Also consult this [document](./LEGAL.md) if you want to know why I believe I'm protected under fair-use law.

## Download

RFD is natively supported on Windows and works on GNU/Linux systems with `wine`.

### As an Executable

This is good for if you want to deploy quickly on any machine with connection to the internet.

#### For Windows

To download _as an executable_, run:

```
mkdir rfd
cd rfd
curl https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution/releases/latest/download/RFD-windows-latest.exe --output RFD.exe
```

To launch RFD, your command line will look something like this:

```
./RFD.exe player -h 127.0.0.1 -p 2005
```

#### For GNU/Linux

Still needs work.

RFD requires `wine` to be installed on your system.

For balance of information, consult [this guide](https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution/blob/main/Guides/Linux/README.MD).

```
mkdir rfd
cd rfd
curl https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution/releases/latest/download/RFD-windows-latest.exe --output RFD.exe
```

To launch RFD, your command line will look something like this:

```
./RFD.exe player -h 127.0.0.1 -p 2005
```

### From [Source](https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

This is good for if you already have Python installed on your machine. Do you want to help contribute to RFD? Use this.

**You need Python 3.12+ on your system.**

To install _from source_, run:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution rfd
cd rfd/Source
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wanna use _venv_? That works too!

To launch RFD, your command line will look something like this:

```
py _main.py player -h 127.0.0.1 -p 2005
```

## Command Syntax

### `server`

Game-specific options are specified in the `--config_path` argument, which defaults to `./GameConfig.toml`.

[**Please review each option in the config file before starting your server up.**](#gameconfigtoml-structure)

As of RFD 0.58.2, the available options are as follows:

```

```

### `player`

As of RFD 0.58.2, the available options are as follows:

```
usage: _main.py player [--rcc_host [RCC_HOST]] [--rcc_port [RCC_PORT]]
                       [--web_host [WEB_HOST]] [--web_port [WEB_PORT]]

```

### `studio`

The `studio` command allows developers to modify existing place files whilst connected to RFD's webserver.

As of RFD 0.58.2, the available options are as follows:

```
usage: _main.py studio [--config_path [CONFIG_PATH] |
                       --place_path [PLACE_PATH]] [--web_port [WEB_PORT]]
                       [--quiet] [--skip_web] [--clear_cache]
                       [--skip_download] [--debug | --debug_all] [--help]

RFD's bundled Studio binaries are very very very ill-prepared. Unless you're
creating CSG unions which won't work otherwise, I recommend using modern
versions of Roblox Studio instead.

options:
  --config_path, --config, -cp [CONFIG_PATH]
                        Game-specific options; defaults to ./GameConfig.toml.
                        Please review each option before starting a new server
                        up.
  --place_path, --place, -pl [PLACE_PATH]
                        Path to the place file to be loaded. Argument
                        `config_path` can't be passed in when using this
                        option.
  --web_port, -wp, -p [WEB_PORT]
                        Port number for the locally-hosted web server to run
                        from.
  --quiet, -q           Suppresses console output.
  --skip_web            Skips hosting the webserver.
  --clear_cache         Deletes cached content specific to the host you are
                        connecting to. Searches in the
                        %LocalAppData%\Temp\Roblox\http directory.
  --skip_download       Disables auto-download of RFD binaries from the
                        internet.
  --debug               Opens an instance of x96dbg and attaches it to the
                        running "studio" binary.
  --debug_all           Opens instances of x96dbg and attaches them to all
                        running binaries.
  --help, -?            show this help message and exit

```

### `serialise`

The `serialise` command allows developers to modify files to be compatible with RFD's asset-loading systems.

As of RFD 0.58.2, the available options are as follows:

```
usage: _main.py studio [--config_path [CONFIG_PATH] |
                       --place_path [PLACE_PATH]] [--web_port [WEB_PORT]]
                       [--quiet] [--skip_web] [--keep_cache] [--skip_download]
                       [--debug | --debug_all] [--help]

RFD's bundled Studio binaries are very very very ill-prepared. Unless you're
creating CSG unions which won't work otherwise, I recommend using modern
versions of Roblox Studio instead.

options:
  --config_path, --config, -cp [CONFIG_PATH]
                        Game-specific options; defaults to ./GameConfig.toml.
                        Please review each option before starting a new server
                        up.

                        Port number for the web server to run from.
  --quiet, -q           Suppresses console output.
  --skip_web            Skips hosting the webserver.
  --keep_cache          Skips deleting cached content specific to the host you
                        are connecting to. Searches in the
                        %LocalAppData%\Temp\Roblox\http directory.
  --skip_download       Disables auto-download of RFD binaries from the
                        internet.
  --debug               Opens an instance of x96dbg and attaches it to the
                        running "studio" binary.
  --debug_all           Opens instances of x96dbg and attaches them to all
                        running binaries.
  --help, -?            show this help message and exit
```

### `download`

The `download` command allows you to download specific versions of Rōblox components.

As of RFD 0.58.2, the available options are as follows:

```
usage: _main.py download [--rbx_version RBX_VERSION]
                         [--bin_subtype {Player,Server,Studio} [{Player,Server,Studio} ...]]
                         [--help]

                        Version to download.
  --bin_subtype, -b {Player,Server,Studio} [{Player,Server,Studio} ...]
                        Directories to download.
  --help, -?            show this help message and exit

```

## Network Ports in Use

**To keep it simple: open port 2005 on both TCP and UDP.**

Anyone can host a server and must leave _both a TCP `-wp` and UDP `-rp` network port_ of their choice accessible.

It's possible to connect to a webserver and an RCC server from different hosts. However, I wouldn't recommend it.

### RCC (UDP)

RCC is an acronym for 'Rōblox Cloud Compute', which is the `exe` program we use to run the Rōblox servers. The UDP-based protocol is derived from (but is incompatible with) [RakNet](http://www.raknet.com/).

Host is specified by the `-h` option (also by `--rcc_host` or `-rh`).

Port is specified by the `-p` option (also by `--rcc_port` or `-rp`).

### Webserver (_unsigned_ HTTPS)

The webserver is responsible for facilitating player connections and loading in-game assets.

Host is optionally specified by the `--webserver_host` or `-wh` option, in case RCC is hosted elsewhere.

Port is specified by the `--webserver_port` or `-wp` option.

## Asset Packs

Assets are automatically cached server-side in directory `./AssetCache`. To manually add assets, place the raw data in a file named with the iden number or string _without_ any extension.

The following are examples of asset idens resolving to cache files:

| Asset Iden                    | File Name          | Format |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| `rbxassetid://1818`           | `./00000001818`    | `%11d` |
| `rbxassetid://5950704`        | `./00005950704`    | `%11d` |
| `rbxassetid://97646706196482` | `./97646706196482` | `%11d` |
| `rbxassetid://custom-asset`   | `./custom-asset`   | `%s`   |

This behaviour can be changed in [your game configuration file](#game_setupasset_cachename_template).

## How About Studio?

You can modify `rbxl` file in current-day Studio as of September 2024. For compatibility with older clients, _RFD comes with its own [serialiser suite](./Source/assets/serialisers/)_. Objects transformed include:

1. Fonts which existed in their respective versions,
1. And meshes encoded with versions 4 or 5 _back_ to version 2 (courtesy [rbxmesh](https://github.com/PrintedScript/RBXMesh/blob/main/RBXMesh.py)).

Some modern programs do weird things to client-sided scripts. They use `Script` classs objects, but with a [`RunContext`](https://robloxapi.github.io/ref/class/BaseScript.html#member-RunContext) property set to [`"Client"`](https://robloxapi.github.io/ref/enum/RunContext.html#member-Client). You will also need to _manually_ convert these objects to `LocalScripts`.

And, **union operations done in current-day Studio (CSG v3) are not supported**. This is because CSG v2 support was completely removed in late 2022.

In that case...

RFD [comes bundled with Studio builds](#studio). These should be used if modern Studio doesn't mesh well with your old places.

[Sodikm](https://archive.org/details/full-sodikm_202308) has a functional Studio build from 2018.

[Rōblox Filtering Disabled](https://beepboopbap.itch.io/filtering-disabled) has a working Studio build from 2022.

You can also use [this 2018M build](https://github.com/Windows81/Roblox-Freedom-Distribution/releases/download/2023-08-31T09%EA%9E%8910Z/v348.Studio.7z) whilst running the Rōblox Filtering Disabled webserver.

If you need any help, please shoot me an issue on GitHub or a message to an account with some form of 'VisualPlugin' elsewhere.

## Directories Affected

The program is mostly portable; RFD does not store any persistent settings to your machine.

However, the Rōblox executables it hooks to write to the following directories:

- `%LocalAppData%\Temp\Roblox\http\`
- `%LocalAppData%\Temp\Roblox\`

You'll also probably find some registry keys written to:

- `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Roblox`

## Examples

Where `...` is [your command-line prefix](#download),

### Server

```shell
... server -p 2005 --config ./GameConfig.toml
```

For quick prototyping, you can just put it the `rbxl` place by itself.

```shell
... server -p 2005 --place ./Place.rbxl
```

The [config data](#gameconfigtoml-structure) can also be piped from `stdin`.

```shell
... echo '{ "server_core": { "place_file": { "rbxl_uri": "_.rbxl" } } }' | ... server --config -
```

### Player

```shell
... player -h 127.0.0.1 -p 2005
```

## `GameConfig.toml` Structure

This specification is current as of 0.58.2. Some options might be different in future versions.

Optionally, `toml` files can be expressed in `json`. The following basic configurations work the same way:

```json
{ "server_core": { "place_file": { "rbxl_uri": "_.rbxl" } } }
```

```toml
server_core.place_file.rbxl_uri = '_.rbxl'
```

```toml
[server_core.place_file]
rbxl_uri = '_.rbxl'
```

### Special Types

#### Functions

Function-type options are very flexible in RFD. _Way_ too flexible if you're asking me.

Look out for `{OPTION}_call_mode`, where `{OPTION}` is the name of the option you're modifying. If `{OPTION}_call_mode` is not specified, RFD tries to assume on its own.

Following is a hypothetical option called `skibidi_plugin`. The examples all do the same thing.

##### Python Mode

```toml
skibidi_plugin_call_mode = "python"
skibidi_plugin = '''
def f(int_val: int, bool_val: bool):
    if int_val == 666:
        return {
            "evil": 666,
        }
    elif bool_val == True:
        return {
            "owo": 7,
        }
    elif int_val == 420 and bool_val == False:
        return {
            "uwu": 3,
        }
    return {
        "camera_man": 1,
        "ohio": 2,
    }
'''
```

Nobody cares what name you give the function. RFD should be smart enough to figure out what you're using.

In Python mode, RFD assigns global constants for your convenience.

| Variable     | Description                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `CONFIG_DIR` | the config file's directory path |

##### Dict Mode

```toml
skibidi_plugin_call_mode = "dict"
skibidi_plugin.666 = {
    "evil": 666,
}
skibidi_plugin.True = {
    "owo": 7,
}
skibidi_plugin.420-False = {
    "uwu": 3,
}
skibidi_plugin.default = {
    "camera_man": 1,
    "ohio": 2,
}
```

Dict keys are access in the following order of precedence:

1. Each of the individual stringified arguments in positional order,
1. The joined string of all arguments with string separators `_`, `,`, then `, `,
1. Then the static key `default`.

##### Lua Mode (unstable)

```toml
skibidi_plugin_call_mode = "lua"
skibidi_plugin = '''
function(int_val, bool_val)
    if int_val == 666 then
        return {
            evil = 666,
        }
    elseif bool_val == true then
        return {
            owo = 7,
        }
    elseif int_val == 420 and bool_val == false then
        return {
            uwu = 3,
        }
    end
    return {
        camera_man = 1,
        ohio = 2,
    }
end
'''
```

### Options

#### `metadata.config_version_wildcard`

Resolves to a wildcard; defaults to `"*"`.

Matches against the `GIT_RELEASE_VERSION` internal constant. Useful for protecting changes in config structure between RFD versions.

#### `server_core.startup_script`

Resolves to type `str`.

Runs at the CoreScript security level whenever a new _server_ is started.

```toml
startup_script = 'game.workspace.FilteringEnabled = false'
```

#### `server_core.metadata.title`

Resolves to type `str`.

#### `server_core.metadata.icon_uri`

Resolves to internal type `uri_obj`.

Can resolve to either a relative or absolute local path -- or extracted from a remote URL.

#### `server_core.place_file.rbxl_uri`

Resolves to internal type `uri_obj`. Files must be encoded in the binary `rbxl` format and not in the human-readable `rbxlx` format.

rbxl_uri = 'https://archive.org/download/robloxBR1/RBR1/RBR1.rbxl'
```

#### `server_core.place_file.enable_saveplace`

Resolves to type `bool`; defaults to false.

When `game:SavePlace()` is called and `enable_saveplace` is true, the file at [`rbxl_uri`](#game_setupplace_filerbxl_uri) is overwritten. It won't work if `rbxl_uri` points to a remote resource.

#### `server_core.place_file.track_file_changes`

Resolves to type `bool`; defaults to false.

When the file at `rbxl_uri` is modified, RCC is restarted such that RFD always runs the latest version of the file. It won't work if `rbxl_uri` points to a remote resource.

#### `remote_data.gamepasses`

Resolves to a data dictionary.

```toml
[[remote_data.gamepasses]]
id_num = 163231044
name = 'EnforcersPowers'
price = 100
```

#### `remote_data.asset_redirects`

Resolves to [function](#functions) type `(int | str) -> asset_redirect`.

When an RFD server receives a request to load an asset by id, it does so from Roblox.com by default.

However, entries in [`asset_redirects`](#remote_dataasset_redirects) override that default.

The following examples notate the structure into the [dict mode](#dict-mode) syntax:

Through the `forward_url` field, clients are automatically redirected to a new URL to load any assets.

Asset redirects with this scheme are _not_ saved to `./AssetCache`.

```toml
[remote_data.asset_redirects.13] # asset iden 13
forward_url = 'https://archive.org/download/youtube-WmNfDXTnKMw/WmNfDXTnKMw.webm'
```

You can include a `cmd_line` field if you want the loaded asset to _literally_ come from the `stdout` of a program installed on the server.

Asset redirects with this scheme _are_ saved to `./AssetCache`.

```toml
[remote_data.asset_redirects.14] # asset iden 14
cmd_line = 'curl https://archive.org/download/youtube-WmNfDXTnKMw/WmNfDXTnKMw.webm -L --output -'
```

A `raw_data` field works here too. That literally encapsuates the binary data that will be sent as an asset.

Asset redirects with this scheme _are_ saved to `./AssetCache`.

```toml
[remote_data.asset_redirects.15]
raw_data = '\0'
```

---

This script (in [Python mode](#python-mode)) should work. It redirects asset iden strings starting wtih `time_music_` to static files on the internet.

```toml
remote_data.asset_redirects = "python"
remote_data.asset_redirects = '''
def f(asset_iden):
    PREFIX = "time_music_"
    if asset_iden.startswith(PREFIX):
        h = int(asset_iden[len(PREFIX):])
        return {
            "forward_url": "https://github.com/Windows81/Time-Is-Musical/blob/main/hour_%02d.wav" % (h % 24)
        }
    return None
'''
```

#### `remote_data.badges`

Resolves to a data dictionary.

```toml
[[remote_data.badges]]
id_num = 757
name = 'Awardable Badge'
price = 1
```
